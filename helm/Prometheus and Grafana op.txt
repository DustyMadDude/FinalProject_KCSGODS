Install Prometheus and Grafana using Helm
For the past few years, an effort was made to build a 'first class' out of the box experience for Kubernetes users integrating Prometheus and Grafana in almost any Kubernetes cluster,
and the fruit of that labor is the kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart, based on the kube-prometheus project.

This Helm chart installs the following in your cluster:

kube-state-metrics (gathers metrics from cluster resources)
Prometheus Node Exporter (gathers metrics from Kubernetes nodes)
Grafana
Grafana dashboards and Prometheus rules for Kubernetes monitoring
To install it, first add the Prometheus Community Helm repo and run helm repo update:

$ helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
$ helm repo update
Then install the stack into the monitoring namespace:

$ kubectl create namespace monitoring
$ helm install prometheus --namespace monitoring prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
Watch the progress in Lens, or via kubectl:

$ kubectl get deployments -n monitoring -w
